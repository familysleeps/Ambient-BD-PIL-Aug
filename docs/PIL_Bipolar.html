<h2>Study Title: Ambient and Passive Collection of Sleep and Circadian
Rhythm Data (AMBIENT-BD)</h2>
<p> <br />
Thank you for your interest in our research study. Please read this
information sheet carefully. Take your time to read it and don’t feel
under any pressure to decide right away. It is important for you to
understand the study fully before you decide to participate or not. If
anything is unclear to you, or if you have any questions at all about
the study, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us by email (<a
href="mailto:ambientBD@mu.ie" class="email">ambientBD@mu.ie</a>).</p>
<p>Ambient-BD is a research study that aims to investigate sleep and
circadian rhythms. It is funded by the Wellcome Trust and will run from
2023-2028. Ambient-BD is a joint project between Maynooth University and
the University of Edinburgh. You are invited to participate in the first
part of the study that will be carried out at Maynooth University.<br />
<br></p>
<div id="why-are-we-doing-this-research-study" class="section level4">
<h4>Why are we doing this research study?</h4>
<p>Circadian rhythms are changes in physiology and behaviour that follow
a 24-hour cycle. For example, the daily rhythm in body temperature,
alertness and the sleep wake cycle are all examples of circadian
rhythms. In fact, almost every cell in the human body is regulated by a
circadian clock, and this does not depend on the light dark cycle or the
timing of food or exercise. Circadian timing has been “hard-wired” into
our physiology by evolution so that humans have 24-hour rhythms by
default.</p>
<p>Deviation from this 24-hour rhythm is associated with detrimental
effects on health and well being, and particularly for mental health.
This might occur through irregular lifestyles, such as shiftwork, but
many diseases are also associated with disturbed circadian rhythms
especially neuropsychiatric conditions. People with bipolar disorder
show signs of disrupted control of 24-hour rhythms such as problems with
sleep timing and mood swings. The overall aim of Ambient-BD project is
to investigate the reasons for this, but in order to do that, we need to
validate methods that allow us to measure circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>The best method for measuring sleep is polysomnography (PSG), a test
that monitors brain and heart activity and movement while people sleep.
PSG can only be used to monitor sleep for 1-2 nights, and is not
suitable for routine sleep assessment. The timing of sleep can be
assessed by measuring increases in a brain hormone called melatonin that
increases in the hours before bedtime. This test is called a “Dim Light
Melatonin Onset (DLMO)” test and involves measuring how quickly the
melatonin levels in your saliva increase around bedtime.</p>
<p>In Ambient-BD we will develop and test new ways to measure rhythms
using radar sensors, and compare them to PSG and DLMO.<br />

<div id="why-am-i-being-asked-to-take-part-in-this-research-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?</h4>
<p>We have asked you to take part because you are a healthy adult with a
diagnosis of bipolar disorder</p>
<p>To participate you must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fluent in English and capable of giving signed, informed
consent<br />
</li>
<li>Aged between 18-50<br />
</li>
<li>Willing and able to install sleep sensors in your bedroom and to
wear a wrist worn accelerometer<br />
</li>
<li>Willing to wear polysomnography sensors on four separate nights
during the 3-month study duration<br />
</li>
<li>Willing for researchers to visit your home<br />
</li>
<li>Willing to collect multiple saliva samples over 8 hours<br />
</li>
<li>Have access to a mobile phone and internet<br />
</li>
<li>Have a diagnosis of BD (DSM5 criteria) with at least one previous
manic or hypomanic episode<br />
</li>
<li>Willing to have a short online interview with a psychiatrist member
of the Ambient-BD team to have your diagnosis confirmed<br />
</li>
<li>Clinically euthymic (no episodes of depression, hypomania or mania)
for at least three months at the time of enrolment in the study</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you meet the conditions above, you cannot take part if you
have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infectious disease<br />
</li>
<li>History of allergy or any skin condition that might be exacerbated
by exposure to wristwatch straps and electrode paste<br />
</li>
<li>Chronic disease (eg diabetes, COPD, cancer, heart disease) *
Intellectual disability<br />
</li>
<li>Pregnancy<br />
</li>
<li>Shiftworker<br />
</li>
<li>Use of recreational drugs or alcohol intake that exceeds HSE
recommendations (&lt; 11 drinks per week for women, &lt; 17 for
men)<br />
</li>
<li>Any disability that might affect sleep or the ability to collect
saliva samples in dim light or sleep in PSG sensors<br />
</li>
<li>Intention to travel across a time zone of more than 2h during the
study period<br />
</li>
<li>Ever sleep with a pet or a child. Because of their small size it is
difficult for the radar sensor to detect your sleep while they are
there. It is possible to assess sleep if an adult sleeping partner is
present<br />
</li>
<li>Have any intention to travel across meridians (time difference more
than 2 hours) during the 3-month study period. This is because “jetlag”
disrupts your sleep</li>
</ul>

<div id="do-i-have-to-take-part" class="section level4">
<h4>Do I have to take part?</h4>
<p>It is important to know that you do not have to take part in this
study if you do not wish to. You can change your mind about
participating in this study at any time, even after the study has begun.
If you decide that you do not want to participate, this will have no
effect on your or their current or future participation in any other
research studies. You do not have to provide a reason for deciding not
to participate or changing your mind. If you wish to opt out at any
point, please contact the research team (Study email: <a
href="mailto:ambientBD@mu.ie" class="email">ambientBD@mu.ie</a>), and we
will organise this for you.<br />

</div>
<div
id="what-happens-if-i-change-my-mind-about-participating-during-the-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>What happens if I change my mind about participating during the
study?</h4>
<p>You can withdraw at any time and without giving a reason. If you
decide to do so, we will immediately remove all of your data from the
study, including your sensor, sleep and questionnaire data. Electronic
copies of data will be overwritten, and hard copies will be destroyed by
incineration. Biological samples will be destroyed by
incineration.<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="how-will-the-study-be-carried-out" class="section level4">
<h4>How will the study be carried out?</h4>
<p>The studies will be carried out as you undergo your usual activities
over 3 months. A researcher will fit the sensors for PSG and to show you
how to collect saliva samples and you will set up the bedroom sensor and
wristwatch yourself. We will always give you instructions and all
materials and equipment needed to complete the study and we will always
be available to answer any questions you have about the study.</p>
<p>You will be asked to do the following tasks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Wear a wrist-worn activity monitor (like a Fitbit) at all times
(day and night) for 3 months. You will need to remove the monitor for
showering or swimming, and put it back on as soon as possible
afterwards. The device will monitor movement and light exposure
continuously throughout the day and night.</p></li>
<li><p>Fit a bedside sensor that monitors movement and environment in
your bedroom for 3 months (see image below). The sensor records the
following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movement</li>
<li>Room temperature</li>
<li>Sound in decibels</li>
<li>Light</li>
</ul>
<p>This sensor uses radar to monitor movement and we can use this
information to design algorithms that can guess whether you are awake or
asleep. We cannot tell what you are doing when you are awake. It records
noise levels, not sounds or voices and ambient light. This sensor
transmits data via the internet to a cloud platform where we can
download your data.<br />
</p>
<p>The sensor has its own internet connection and you will not be able
to download the data or access the sensor controls. It is unobtrusive
and makes no sound, and has no display. If you go on holiday or stay
somewhere else overnight, we will ask you to bring their bedside sensor,
if possible. You will need to keep the modem and the sensor plugged into
the mains at all times to power the sensor.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete some questionnaires about your health, lifestyle and
sleep. The questionnaires will be completed at three time points during
the 3-month study. Questionnaires will take approximately 10 minutes
each to complete. You will need to keep a sleep diary for the 3 month
study period. You will also need to complete a short online interview
with a psychiatrist member of the Ambient-BD research team to confirm
your diagnosis of bipolar disorder.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform a melatonin test that will involve collecting saliva
samples every 30 mins for 6 hours before bedtime and 2 hours after
bedtime. This is called a “Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO)” test and it
measures how quickly the melatonin levels in your saliva increase at
bedtime. You will need to do this once at the beginning and once at the
end of the study. You will receive instructions from a trained
researcher on how to collect these saliva samples and we will provide
you with saliva collection kits. Melatonin is a hormone of darkness and
light will surpress it straightaway. For this reason, the test must be
performed in dim light and we will help you to adjust the light levels
in your home for that. During the test, you will be allowed to read
using a booklight that we will provide, and use screens at low light
intensity. You can eat and drink during the test but not leave the
dim-lit area so you will need to make sure you have any food that you
need in the room where the test will take place.</p></li>
<li><p>Complete a Polysomnography Sleep Test for 2 nights at the
beginning and end of the 3-month study. This will happen at the same
time as the melatonin test. Researchers will visit your home each night
and fit the following sensors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A nasal cannula to monitor airflow</li>
<li>A control unit strapped to your chest</li>
<li>ECG sensors to monitor heart rate and rhythm</li>
<li>Straps to monitor chest and upper abdominal wall movement.<br />
</li>
<li>Oxygen saturation sensor worn on the finger</li>
<li>Skin sensors to monitor muscle tone in your chin, leg, chin and
eye</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to sleep overnight wearing all of these sensors and
then remove them yourself the following morning.</p></li>

<div id="when-will-i-need-to-do-all-these-tasks-if-i-agree-to-take-part"
class="section level4">
<h4>When will I need to do all these tasks if I agree to take part?</h4>
<p>The tasks in this study will be arranged at times that suit you.
There will need to be 3 months where you are able to wear the wrist
strap and use the bedside sensor continuously. It is no problem to take
this items to another location if you need to travel during this time.
During the 3 months you will need to have 2 days in month 1 and 2 days
in month 3 that you are free to do the PSG and DLMO tests in your
home.</p>
<p>After you have read this information sheet, and if you decide that
the study is something you would still be interested in, we will have a
short conversation (in person, by phone, MS Teams or email) to ensure
that you are eligible to participate. This conversation is confidential
and the information you give us at this time will not be recorded. If
you meet the inclusion criteria, we will then send you information on
what is involved and give you time to read this and to ask questions.
Next we will ask you to meet again (in person or online, your choice) to
give written consent to participate. Next you will need to have a
screening PSG session to make sure that your sleep patterns are healthy
before you can continue participating. If that is clear, then we will
enroll you into the study and arrange a 3-month study window that suits
you to participate. All tests will be carried out in your home and you
must be happy for the researchers to visit to set up the PSG sensors and
show you how to perform the melatonin tests. The researchers will be
male or female trained scientists, but they are not medical doctors and
you will not be offered any medical advice at any point during this
study. You will have the names and contact details of the researchers
who you can contact at any time during the study, should you have any
questions. You will need to complete questionnaires about your heath,
lifestyle and sleep at the beginning, middle and end of the 3-month
study. The diagram below summarises what you will need to do and
when.</p>
<p>DMLO stands for Dim Light Melatonin Onset, this test will monitor the
rate at which melatonin (a hormone that signals darkness) rises in your
saliva as bedtime approaches. PSG stands for polysomnography, a test
that monitors sleep by measuring brain and muscle activity.</p>
<p>To summarise, over the 3 months we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>record questionnaire data at three timepoints</li>
<li>continuously record daily movement data using the wrist worn
sensors, and the bedside sensor</li>
<li>measure melatonin evening increase in saliva on and measure sleep by
PSG on two occasions during the 3-months</li>
</ul>

<h4>Can the sensors record images?</h4>
<p>No, the sensors only measure movement in space, none of them can
acquire images.<br />

<div id="can-the-sensors-record-what-i-am-saying-or-other-sounds"
class="section level4">
<h4>Can the sensors record what I am saying or other sounds?</h4>
<p>No, the sensors record noise levels in decibels, they can’t identify
sounds or record speech.<br />
<br></p>

<div id="can-the-sensors-identify-my-location" class="section level4">
<h4>Can the sensors identify my location?</h4>
<p>No, none of our sensor have GPS or capacity to identify or record

<div id="can-the-bedside-radar-sensors-identify-what-i-am-doing"
class="section level4">
<h4>Can the bedside radar sensors identify what I am doing?</h4>
<p>The sensors record data on movement but it is not possible to
identify what someone is doing other then whether they are awake or not.
We apply algorithms to the movement data at each timepoint to classify
whether the person is asleep or awake – it is a binary variable, either
awake or asleep, nothing else. The data cannot be used to detect sexual
or any other activity nor would we ever attempt to detect anything other
than the classification of being awake or asleep.<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="can-the-bedside-radar-sensor-record-data-from-my-partner"
class="section level4">
<h4>Can the bedside radar sensor record data from my partner?</h4>
<p>The sensors will only record data from you and not your partner (as
long as you are the person closest to the sensor). Your participation in
this study does affect your partner as we will record light, sound and
temperature data in their bedroom, and we ask you to make sure anyone
sharing your bedroom is happy for you to participate.<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="are-there-any-benefits-to-me-if-i-take-part-in-the-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>Are there any benefits to me if I take part in the study?</h4>
<p>Medical advances depend on the goodwill of volunteers that
participate in research studies, and we believe that you will benefit
from knowing you are making a valuable contribution to finding ways to
help people with bipolar disorder. We are very grateful to everyone that
participates in our research.</p>
<p>You will receive data from the radar sensors that show how your own
sleep patterns and the environmental conditions in your bedroom vary
over 3 months. This will benefit you by helping you to understand more
about how you sleep over a long period of time. We will give you this
data for your own interest at the end of the study, but we are not
medical doctors and we won’t be able to help you understand it.</p>
<p>In recognition of the time and effort it will take you to perform the
PSG and melatonin tests on two occasions, we will give you a gift
voucher of 250 euros when you have completed both tests.</p>
<p>We will not return the results of your melatonin tests, as these are
research data and it would be difficult to understand what they mean at
an individual level.<br />

<h4>Are there any risks to me or others if I take part in the

<p>We have taken great care to identify and address any potential safety
concerns, and we do not consider that taking part presents a risk to the

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There is a small possibility that you might develop skin
irritation or redness from the wrist worn strap or from the paste and
tape used to attach the sensors to your skin in the PSG study, and we
will ask you to be vigilant to this, and to remove the strap immediately
and withdraw from the study if signs of irritation are detected. All the
items we use are medical-grade and we do not anticipate skin irritation
to be a serious risk. We will send you two test sensor stickers to wear
on your chest for 24 hours before the test, so that participant prone to
skin irriation do not progress to the full PSG.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a chance that the cables and wires of the sensors could
be a trip hazard and we ask you to take care when moving near them and
to make sure that all ends are tucked away.<br />

your name or contact details. This is not only for electronically stored
data. For example, physical copies of questionnaires, your saliva
samples will be labelled with your unique study IDs and not your name.
Only the authorised research team at Maynooth University will have
access to the ‘key’ that links your name to your ID code, and this
information will be stored on an encrypted file on a password protected
computer at Maynooth University. Neither your name nor ID code will be
used when reporting the results of this research for publication or
presentation; your contribution will be entirely anonymous. In this way,
even the researchers working directly with your data will not know which
participant it comes from; this link can only be made by retrieving the
key.</p>
<p>The only reason we have a key at all is so that we can contact you to
collect sensors and follow up with results, and we will destroy the key
and all your contact information as soon as possible. This will be when
you have completed the study, and the contact information of all
participants will be destroyed in December 2026.<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="what-other-data-will-be-collected-about-me-during-the-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>What other data will be collected about me during the study?</h4>
<p>There are three types of data in this study (i) personal,
identifiable data, (ii) personal data, (iii) anonymised data.</p>
<p>The personal, identifiable information that we will collect are your
name, address and contact details (phone number and email address).
These data can be used to identify you and are highly confidential. They
will never be written on any of your research data items such as
questionnaires or samples or sensor results. They will be linked to your
research data via your study ID number and kept in a locked office or
secure network that is separate to the research data stores. This means
that even the Ambient-BD researchers will not be able to tell the
identify of the participants from the research data they are working on.
We will delete your identifiable data as soon as the study is over.</p>
<p>The research data that we collect about you includes personal
information such as data on sleep, sensor data, lifestyle and health,
age and sex, but these data are not unique to you and cannot be used to
identify you without access to the ID code key. These data are
de-identified until the end of the study (or Dec 2026 whichever is
first) at which point all identifiable data are deleted and all personal
data are anonymised. The personal research data will be identified only
by an ID number and will be stored in a secure location on the MU
server. De-identified data will not be shared with anyone outside the
research team.</p>
<p>Anonymised data means that all connections to your identity have been
irretrievably destroyed and there is no way that anyone (not even the
researchers) can ever find out that information came from you. We ask
your consent to retain this anonymous information indefinitely and to
share it with other researchers and via scientific repositories.
Repositories are public databases that can be accessed by anyone and are
very important for progressing science and preventing other scientists
repeating work that has already been done. Releasing our research data
into the public domain like this means that science will benefit for
many years after our project has finished, and that the experiments do
not have to be repeated.<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div
id="will-any-of-my-data-be-shared-with-anyone-outside-maynooth-university"
class="section level4">
<h4>Will any of my data be shared with anyone outside Maynooth
University?</h4>
<p>Some of your de-identified (not your identifiable information)
personal information (date of birth, sex and sensor data) will be shared
with three companies that we use to analyse data. The companies are (i)
VitalThings (Norway), (ii) Onlinesurveys.ac.uk (UK) and (iii) Novolytix
(Switzerland). Details of these companies and why we need to share data
with them are given below. We emphasise that we will never share data
that could identify you with anyone outside of the study team. None of
these companies will be given your name, all of the data shared will be
identified by a study ID number.</p>
<p>VitalThings supply the radar sensors that we use and they are
responsible for the transmission of data from the sensors to a cloud
based platform that they maintain, and where the data are stored until
the researchers at Maynooth University can download it. This method of
temporary data storage in the cloud is the most efficient way that we
can acquire and store large amounts of sensor data. They require access
to your age and sex in order to calculate your sleep information. These
data are identified by a study ID and can never be used to infer your
identity. They will be made completely anonymous by Maynooth University
researchers once the data have been downloaded.</p>
<p>Onlinesurveys.ac.uk are a specialist company that deliver surveys for
academic research online. They provide the platform that collects your
questionnaire data. The surveys will be identified by a study ID number
only and there is no way that onlinesurveys.ac.uk can know which
participant any survey relates to.</p>
<p>Novolytix will analyse your saliva samples to measure melatonin. We
will send them your samples labelled with your study ID number but they
will not be given any other information. They will report the results to
us and then they will delete all your data and destroy any remaining
saliva sample.</p>
<p>A data processing agreement has been signed between Maynooth
University and VitalThings, onlinesurveys.ac.uk and Novolytix that will
ensure that they maintain high standards of data security and governance
and that they are GDPR compliant.</p>
<p>These companies will never be given access to your name, address or
contact information. Following completion of the study, they will delete
your data. After the study we will delete all your identifiable details
so that your data are completely anonymous. We will store these
anonymised data indefinitely in Maynooth University and in data
repositories so that they can be used in future research and/or for
teaching purposes (for example, student projects).</p>
<p>To summarise exactly who your data will be shared with:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Your identifiable data (eg name, address) will not be shared with
anyone outside the research team at Maynooth University</li>
<li>Your de-identified personal data will be shared with companies that
help us to collect data - VitalThings, Novolytix and
onlinesurveys.ac.uk</li>
<li>There will be no limit on sharing of your anonymised data at the end
of the study – they are open access for use by anyone. This will never
include any data that could possibly identify you.</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div id="what-will-happen-to-my-saliva-samples-at-the-end-of-the-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>What will happen to my saliva samples at the end of the study?</h4>
<p>All saliva samples will be retained by Maynooth University
indefinitely after anonymisation and may be shared with other
researchers interested in addressing the hypothesis of Ambient-BD. They
will not be made available for any other purpose. Unfortunately we
cannot ask for your explicit contest to participate in future studies,
since the samples will have been anonymised at this point. Instead we
ask for your consent in advance for your samples to be used in future
studies that address the importance of sleep and circadian rhythms.
Future studies will only be allowed to analyse biochemicals and hormones
in your saliva; we will never extract or analyse any genetic information
from your samples. We are not able to tell you now what these studies
will be, as they will involve the scientific techniques that will be
available in the future. Remember that the samples will be anonymised
and can’t be linked to you in any way.<br />

<div
id="what-happens-to-my-data-and-saliva-samples-if-i-decide-to-withdraw"
class="section level4">
<h4>What happens to my data and saliva samples if I decide to
withdraw?</h4>
<p>If you decide to withdraw from the study, then all data will be
deleted and saliva samples will be destroyed; nothing will be retained
for anonymisation in this case. You will be completely removed from the
study. If you withdraw we will ensure that our third party processor,
VitalThings deletes your de-identified data from the sensors, sex and
date of birth data. If you complete the study, your data will be
anonymised and it will not be possible to withdraw from the study after
this point.<br />

<div
id="will-my-personal-data-andor-sensor-data-be-used-in-future-studies"
class="section level4">
<h4>Will my personal data and/or sensor data be used in future
studies?</h4>
<p>The data we collect will be anonymised once the sensors, samples and
questionnaires have been returned, so it will not be possible for
anyone, including the research team to identify the participants from
the datasets. With your consent, we will retain these anonymous datasets
indefinitely. These datasets may be used in teaching or research.<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="will-i-have-access-to-the-data-generated-by-future-studies"
class="section level4">
<h4>Will I have access to the data generated by future studies?</h4>
<p>No. Following completion of the study or withdrawal from the study,
your identifiable personal information including your name, address and
contact details will be destroyed. All other data (sensor, melatonin and
questionnaire data) will then be anonymised (it will no longer be linked
back to you), and it will not be possible for us or anyone to identify
you. For this reason, we cannot return any of your results after
anonymization and you will not be able to withdraw, request access, or
to make any amendments after the data are anonymised. This anonymised
data will be held in Maynooth University and made available in public
repositories for indefinite open access.<br />

</div>
<div
id="who-will-access-my-identifiable-personal-data-as-part-of-this-study"
class="section level4">
<h4>Who will access my identifiable personal data as part of this
study?</h4>
<p>Only the authorised researchers named above, working in the research
team at Maynooth University will have access to your identifiable
personal data including your name, address, and contact details. All
other data (sensor data, age, biological sex, clinical information,
melatonin data and sleep data) are only identifiable by your unique
study ID. We will never label your questionnaires, saliva samples or
sensor data with your name or contact details. VitalThings, Novolytix
and onlinesurveys.ac.uk cannot access your identifiable information.
Only the research team at MU can ever find out your identify, and this
is only for the purposes of contacting you about the study. As soon as
the study is completed all your identifiable information will be
destroyed and there is no way that you can ever be linked to study data
again.<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="how-will-my-privacy-be-protected" class="section level4">
<h4>How will my privacy be protected?</h4>
<p>Your personal information will be kept entirely confidential, and we
will exercise our duties in handling your personal data as per the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Protecting your privacy is
extremely important to all the research team members at Maynooth
University. Personal Identifiers, such as your name or email are never
used to label your questionnaires, sensor data or saliva samples. All
data will be stored on password protected files on a secure network in
Maynooth University. No one outside of the research team in Maynooth
University will have access to your name or contact information and all
other data will be labelled with your unique study ID. Please note that
even the members of the research team that are working on the study on a
daily basis will not know from which participant the data came from. To
find this out, they would need to access a controlled file that connects
your study ID to your identity, and to do so would be a violation of the
research undertaking agreement that they have signed with Maynooth
University. You will be known only by your study ID number; we retain
identifiable information only for the purposes of contacting you during
the study period.</p>
<p>Although all measures will be taken to protect your privacy, there is
a remote risk that a connection to your contact details could be made,
e.g., through unauthorised access to servers or premises at Maynooth
University. To minimise this risk, any files containing these data are
password protected and have restricted access, or are in locked cabinets
in locked offices. Any attempt to identify you in this manner would be a
legal breach against the permitted use of the research data.</p>
<p>When you have returned the sensors, questionnaires, and samples, and
the study is complete, your contact details will be incinerated in the
case of written records, and electronic data will be reformatted or
overwritten by the research team at Maynooth University and all data
will be anonymous.<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-lawful-basis-to-use-my-personal-data"
class="section level4">
<h4>What is the lawful basis to use my personal data?</h4>
<p>As part of the study your personal data will only be used for
scientific research which is in the public interests (Article 6 (e) and
Article 9( 2) (j) of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)).<br />
<br></p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-my-rights" class="section level4">
<h4>What are my rights?</h4>
<p>Under the GDPR, you are entitled to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right to access to your data and receive a copy of it</li>
<li>The right to restrict or object to processing of your data</li>
<li>The right to object to any further processing of the information we
hold about you (except where it is de-identified)</li>
<li>The right to have inaccurate information about you corrected or
deleted</li>
<li>The right to receive your data in a portable format and to have it
transferred to another data controller</li>
<li>The right to request deletion of your data.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rights to access to your data are forfeit in this study by the
complete anonymisation of the data. Complete anonymisation is to protect
the privacy and data security of the participants, but it also means
that it is impossible for you to access your data for any reason. We
will not record the identity of the participants that provided any
specific item of data, so we will not be able to give you access to your
data or to make any amendments.</p>
<p>It must be recognized that, in some circumstances, confidentiality of
research data and records may be overridden by courts in the event of
litigation or in the course of investigation by lawful authority. In
such circumstances the University will take all reasonable steps within
law to ensure that confidentiality is maintained to the greatest
possible extent.<br />
